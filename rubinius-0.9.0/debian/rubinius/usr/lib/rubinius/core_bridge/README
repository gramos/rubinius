This directory contains files that implement essential features of
the Rubinius bootstrap library. The goal is to enable the Rubinius
core libraries to be run on other implementations like MRI and
JRuby.

This is an experiment. We don't know if this will work. Also, you
can probably expect this to be quite slow, since for example, we
will not use any of the data structures of the target implementation.
For example, in Rubinius the Tuple is a core data structure implemented
in the VM. We model the Tuple as a linked-list where each node is a
Ruby object.
